        <b>STEM Students on the Stage (SOS)</b> ™ is a rigorous, interdisciplinary, and standards-based STEM education model created by Harmony Public Schools educators. Through a perfect blend of teacher-facilitated and student-centered instruction, the model helps teachers create personalized learning experiences for all students with high level inquiry based lessons that engage students through project based learning (PBL) approach. Harmony’s PBL approach is to maintain the focus on standards-based teaching while enriching and extending the learning of students through PBL projects. The goal is to promote not only collaborative skills and student ownership of learning but also to promote student success in state and national standards.<br><br>
